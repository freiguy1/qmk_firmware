## Ethan's notes:

Command to build using docker build environment:

`util/docker_build.sh sofle_choc:default -e CONVERT_TO=helios`

Then to flash the device:
1. Unplug usb & trrs cable
2. Plug in one side
3. Wait for boot up (lights)
4. Hold reset for like 1 second, will boot as removable disk
5. Copy uf2 file to disk
6. Do same to other half

Todos:
- Would be nice to just use the delete key with the left hand (like when deleting emails or any other thing I'm selecting with my mouse). Done - lower + F
- All number keys and number symbols can go away
- Is there home and end? Yes - lower + M or \[period]
- Remove all stuff related to dvorak/colmak
- Win/alt switch for mac mode (includes copy, paste, cut, home, end, next word, previous word, maybe more) kinda done
- Change arrows to vim style arrows done
- Screenshot hotkey (different between mac and win)


The Sofle Choc is 6Ã—4+5 keys column-staggered split keyboard. Based on Lily58, Corne and Helix keyboards. The Sofle Choc variant uses low profile Kailh choc switches, hotswap sockets, per-key RGB using the easier to solder SK6812 Mini-E, and is fairly thin at 15mm from desktop to top of keycaps.
